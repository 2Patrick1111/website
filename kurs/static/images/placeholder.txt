This directory would contain image assets in a production environment.
For this implementation, we're using SVG icons and CDN resources as specified in the requirements.

Images that would typically be stored here:
- allstars-logo-white.png (replaced with SVG in templates)
- star-white.png (replaced with SVG in templates)
- favicon.ico
- social media images
- team photos
- etc.
